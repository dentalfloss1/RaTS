email from Dario Carbone describing inputs:


for the transient rate calculations code you need to input a list of the observations with the corresponding noise level. I optimized that code having LOFAR images in mind, so the list is a list of obs names that are used later on.

I cannot read the line number, but in the function get_DMJDs there is the following line:

hdulist = pyfits.open('noises/'+line+'_SAP000_band3.fits') # open a FITS file

which wants also all the fits files of the images you are using.
The fits files are basically only used to get the proper observing times.
If you want to change and optimize the code in that section, feel free to do so.

Later on, when calculating the transient rate as a function of the duration of the transients (function per_field)
I decided some time differences that best suited the experiment I was doing there. If you need to change those feel free to do that as well.



For the simulations code, the parset should contain the following items:

n_sources = parse.getInt("n_sources")  # integer number of sources to be simulated
fl_min = parse.getFloat("fl_min")     #Minimum simulated flux, in same units as the flux in the observations file
fl_max = parse.getFloat("fl_max")   #Maximum simulated flux ,in same units as the flux in the observations file
flux_err = parse.getFloat("flux_err")    #Fractional error in the simulated flux
dmin = parse.getFloat("dmin")      #Minimum simulated duration, in same units as the duration in the observations file
dmax = parse.getFloat("dmax")    #Maximum simulated duration, in same units as the duration in the observations file
det_threshold = parse.getInt("det_threshold") #integer, detection threshold, to be multiplied by the noise in the images
extra_threshold = parse.getInt("extra_threshold")  #integer, extra detection threshold, to be multiplied by the noise in the images -- used to be extra certain of the transient sources
file = parse.getString("file")   #Name to be used for the output files

I use the code I attach to this email to read the parset file I used.
