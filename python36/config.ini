[INITIAL PARAMETERS]
n_sources = 2e6  # integer number of sources to be simulated
fl_min = 5e-6     #Minimum simulated flux, in same units as the flux in the observations file
fl_max = 5e-3   #Maximum simulated flux ,in same units as the flux in the observations file
flux_err = 1e-1    #Fractional error in the simulated flux
dmin = 7e-4      #Minimum simulated duration, in same units as the duration in the observations file
dmax = 3e3    #Maximum simulated duration, in same units as the duration in the observations file
det_threshold = 5 #detection threshold, to be multiplied by the noise in the images
extra_threshold = 3  #integer, extra detection threshold, to be multiplied by the noise in the images -- used to be extra certain of the transient sources
file = "output"   #Name to be used for the output files
lightcurvetype = "tophat" #########Currently must be either "tophat" or "fred"

[SIMULATED OBSERVATIONS PARAMETERS]   # ignored if observations are specified
nobs = 46 # Number of observations to be simulated
obssens = 31.7e-6 # Average sensitivity of simulated observations in Jy
obssig = 4.6e-6 # std dev of simulated sens in Jy
obsinterval = 7 # interval between simulated observations in days
obsdurations = 0.009 # duration of observations in days
